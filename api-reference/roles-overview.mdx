## Overview

The Key Role Assignments API helps you track important stakeholders and their roles within customer organizations. This is essential for understanding decision-making structures and maintaining strong customer relationships.

## What are Key Roles?

Key roles identify important individuals in your customer organizations who influence product adoption, renewal decisions, or act as advocates. Examples include:

- **Champions**: Internal advocates who promote your product
- **Decision Makers**: Executives with purchasing authority
- **Technical Contacts**: Primary technical points of contact
- **Economic Buyers**: Budget holders
- **End Users**: Primary product users

## Entity Types

Role assignments can be associated with:

### Company Level
Roles at the company level apply across the entire organization:
```json
{
  "entityType": "company",
  "externalEntityId": "acme-corp"
}
```

### Account Level
Roles at the account level are specific to a particular business unit or division:
```json
{
  "entityType": "account",
  "externalEntityId": "acme-enterprise-account"
}
```

## Tenure Tracking

The tenure object tracks when someone holds a particular role:

```json
{
  "tenure": {
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2024-12-31"
  }
}
```

- **startDate**: When the person took on this role
- **endDate**: When they left the role (optional - omit for current roles)

This historical tracking helps you:
- Identify relationship changes over time
- Track role transitions during reorganizations
- Maintain historical context for customer relationships

## Use Cases

### 1. Track Champions
Identify and monitor product champions within customer organizations:
```bash
POST /api/v1/key-role-assignments
{
  "assignments": [{
    "roleKey": "champion",
    "entityType": "company",
    "externalEntityId": "acme-corp",
    "userEmail": "sarah.johnson@acme.com",
    "tenure": {
      "startDate": "2024-01-15"
    }
  }]
}
```

### 2. Map Decision Makers
Understand the approval chain for renewals:
```bash
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?roleKey=decision_maker&entityType=company&externalEntityId=acme-corp
```

### 3. Track Role Changes
Update assignments when stakeholders change positions:
```bash
PUT /api/v1/key-role-assignments/{assignmentId}
{
  "tenure": {
    "endDate": "2024-06-30"
  }
}
```

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up Role Assignments

1. **Identify Key Stakeholders**: Determine who should be tracked
2. **Define Role Keys**: Establish consistent role identifiers (e.g., "champion", "decision_maker")
3. **Create Assignments**: Use batch endpoints to create multiple assignments
4. **Link to Entities**: Associate roles with companies or specific accounts

### Querying Role Information

```bash
# Get all roles for a company
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?entityType=company&externalEntityId=acme-corp

# Get all champions across all customers
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?roleKey=champion

# Get account-specific roles
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?entityType=account&externalEntityId=acme-enterprise-account
```

### Maintaining Historical Data

When stakeholders change:
1. Set `endDate` on the current assignment
2. Create a new assignment for the replacement
3. Both records remain for historical tracking

## Integration with CRM

Key role assignments complement your CRM data by:
- Providing structured role tracking
- Supporting multi-level organizational hierarchies
- Maintaining temporal history
- Enabling relationship analytics

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Role Keys**: Use standardized role identifiers across your organization
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep tenure information current as stakeholders change
3. **Multi-Level Tracking**: Assign roles at both company and account levels where appropriate
4. **Historical Preservation**: Never delete old assignments; set end dates instead
5. **Email Accuracy**: Use verified email addresses for reliable stakeholder identification

## Example Role Keys

While you can define custom roles, here are common examples:

- `champion` - Product advocate
- `decision_maker` - Purchasing authority
- `technical_contact` - Primary technical liaison
- `economic_buyer` - Budget holder
- `end_user` - Primary user
- `executive_sponsor` - C-level sponsor
- `procurement` - Procurement contact
