## Overview

The Key Role Assignments API helps you manage the assignment of your internal team members to customer companies and accounts. This is essential for tracking ownership, ensuring accountability, and maintaining clear lines of responsibility across your customer base.

## What are Key Role Assignments?

Key role assignments map your internal team members to customer entities (companies or accounts). Each assignment specifies:

- **Who**: An internal team member (identified by email)
- **What**: Their role (CSM, AE, Onboarding Manager, etc.)
- **Where**: Which customer company or account they're assigned to
- **When**: The tenure period of this assignment

## Common Internal Roles

Typical roles you might assign include:

- **CSM** (Customer Success Manager): Primary point of contact for ongoing customer success
- **AE** (Account Executive): Sales representative managing the account
- **Onboarding Manager**: Team member responsible for customer onboarding
- **Technical Account Manager**: Technical point of contact for the account
- **Implementation Specialist**: Handles product implementation
- **Support Lead**: Primary support contact
- **Account Owner**: Overall account ownership

## Entity Types

Assignments can be made at two levels:

### Company Level
Assign team members to entire customer organizations:
```json
{
  "roleKey": "csm",
  "entityType": "company",
  "externalEntityId": "acme-corp",
  "userEmail": "sarah.jones@yourcompany.com"
}
```

### Account Level
Assign team members to specific accounts within a company:
```json
{
  "roleKey": "ae",
  "entityType": "account",
  "externalEntityId": "acme-enterprise-account",
  "userEmail": "john.smith@yourcompany.com"
}
```

## Tenure Tracking

Track when team members are assigned and unassigned:

```json
{
  "tenure": {
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2024-12-31"
  }
}
```

- **startDate**: When the team member was assigned to this role
- **endDate**: When they were unassigned (optional - omit for current assignments)

This historical tracking helps you:
- Maintain accountability records
- Track team member workload over time
- Analyze customer handoffs and transitions
- Generate historical ownership reports

## Use Cases

### 1. Assign CSM to Customer
Assign a Customer Success Manager to a company:
```bash
POST /api/v1/key-role-assignments
{
  "assignments": [{
    "roleKey": "csm",
    "entityType": "company",
    "externalEntityId": "acme-corp",
    "userEmail": "sarah.jones@yourcompany.com",
    "tenure": {
      "startDate": "2024-01-15"
    }
  }]
}
```

### 2. Find All Accounts for a CSM
Query all companies assigned to a specific CSM:
```bash
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?roleKey=csm&userEmail=sarah.jones@yourcompany.com
```

### 3. View Complete Team for a Company
See all team members assigned to a customer:
```bash
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?entityType=company&externalEntityId=acme-corp
```

### 4. Handle CSM Transition
When a CSM transitions off an account:
```bash
# End the current CSM's assignment
PUT /api/v1/key-role-assignments/{assignmentId}
{
  "tenure": {
    "endDate": "2024-06-30"
  }
}

# Create new assignment for replacement CSM
POST /api/v1/key-role-assignments
{
  "assignments": [{
    "roleKey": "csm",
    "entityType": "company",
    "externalEntityId": "acme-corp",
    "userEmail": "new.csm@yourcompany.com",
    "tenure": {
      "startDate": "2024-07-01"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup

1. **Define Role Keys**: Establish standard role identifiers (e.g., "csm", "ae", "onboarding_manager")
2. **Batch Import**: Use batch endpoints to create initial assignments for all customers
3. **Verify Coverage**: Query to ensure all customers have required roles assigned

### Ongoing Management

```bash
# Get all current CSM assignments
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?roleKey=csm

# Get team coverage for a specific company
GET /api/v1/key-role-assignments?entityType=company&externalEntityId=acme-corp

# Update assignment when team members change
PUT /api/v1/key-role-assignments/{assignmentId}
```

### Reporting and Analytics

- Track team member workload by counting assignments
- Identify customers without key role assignments
- Analyze assignment history for handoff patterns
- Generate coverage reports by role type

## Integration Scenarios

Key role assignments integrate with:

- **CRM Systems**: Sync ownership information
- **Ticketing Tools**: Route support tickets to assigned team members
- **Business Intelligence**: Generate team utilization reports
- **Workflow Automation**: Trigger notifications on assignment changes

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Role Keys**: Use standardized role identifiers across all assignments (e.g., "csm", not "customer_success_manager" or "cs_manager")
2. **Complete Coverage**: Ensure every active customer has critical roles assigned (especially CSM)
3. **Historical Preservation**: Never delete assignments; set end dates to maintain history
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review assignments to ensure they're current
5. **Team Email Addresses**: Use verified work email addresses for all team members
6. **Multi-Level Assignments**: Use both company and account levels appropriately based on your org structure

## Example Role Keys

Standardize on role keys that match your organizational structure:

- `csm` - Customer Success Manager
- `ae` - Account Executive
- `onboarding_manager` - Onboarding Manager
- `tam` - Technical Account Manager
- `implementation_specialist` - Implementation Specialist
- `support_lead` - Support Lead
- `sales_engineer` - Sales Engineer
- `account_owner` - Account Owner
