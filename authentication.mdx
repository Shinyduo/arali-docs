description: 'Secure your API requests with Bearer Token authentication'
---

## Overview

All Arali API endpoints require authentication via Bearer Token. The token is passed in the `Authorization` header of every request.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>
```

## Token Information

Your API token automatically provides the following context:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `enterpriseId` | Your enterprise identifier |
| `integrationAccountId` | Integration account context |
| `scopes` | Authorized permissions for this token |

## Available Scopes

Scopes control what actions your API token can perform. When creating a token, select only the scopes you need.

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when the token is missing or invalid.

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid token"
}
```

<Warning>
  If you receive a 401 error, check that:
  - Your token is correctly formatted
  - The token has not expired or been revoked
  - There are no extra spaces or characters
</Warning>

### 403 Forbidden

Returned when the token lacks the required scope for the operation.

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions. Required scope: companies:write"
}
```

<Tip>
  If you receive a 403 error, you'll need to generate a new token with the required scopes.
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep Tokens Secret" icon="shield">
    Never expose your API token in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Minimal Scopes" icon="minimize">
    Only request the scopes you actually need. This limits potential damage if a token is compromised.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Rotate your API tokens periodically, especially if team members leave or tokens may have been exposed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Environment Variables" icon="terminal">
    Store tokens in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your application.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example: Validating Your Token

Test your token by fetching the companies list:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.arali.ai/api/v1/companies' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

A successful response indicates your token is valid and has the `companies:read` scope.
